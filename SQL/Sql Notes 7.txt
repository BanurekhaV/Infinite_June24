Cursors : are objects that store the result set of any query and allows traversal over the rows
They are of 2 types

   - Implicit Cursors : are created by the database engine automatically and process it
   - Explicit Cursors : user defined cursors that can be used for traversal and manipulations


Life Cycle of a cursor :
  1. Declare a Cursor
  2. Open the cursor
  3. Fetch data as long as there are rows
  4. Close the cursor
  5. Deallocate the Cursor

Forward only : can move only forward (1st row, 2nd row..)
Static : Cursors that do not reflect any updations made after opening the cursor
Dynamic : Cursors which allow us to see the updations after opening the cursor
Keyset : These cursors are driven by keysets of unique values



File Groups : Primary group which is the default group
we can create many secondary groups
Multiple file groups helps to store data in a granular manner

  when we create a database, sql server creates 2 files
    1. A data file (.mdf)
    2. Transaction Log file (.ldf)
