Error Handling within Procedure
SQL allows simple error handlers with begin try and begin catch blocks
- we can raise and throw specific user defined errors
- All predefined errors Nos are below 50000, and user defined are above 50000. Error number is a unique identifier for each error that occurs

Severity Level : It tells us the importance of the error. This ranges between 0 and 24
  0-9 : not severe , and is considered as status messages/information
  11-16 : Indicates user generated errors
  17-19 : Indicates Software errors and cannot be corrected by the user. Must be reported to the sysadmin
  20-24 : Indicate fatal errors that can damage the database/system. Here the database connection immediately terminates to ensure database security
