Selection - *
Projection - col list
Predicate - where condition

--Functions to the RHS of a where clause will not work
Example:

select * from tblemployees where Salary > avg(Salary)

Group By :  
- All columns in the select list apart from the aggregates have to be included in the group by 



where clause : works on each row to check if the condition is met
having clause : works on each group to check if the condition is met     

The DQL works in the following order
  - from clause
  - where clause
  - group by clause
  - having clause  
  - order by clause   
  - select
