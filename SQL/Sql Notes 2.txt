Selection - *
Projection - col list
Predicate - where condition

--Functions to the RHS of a where clause will not work
Example:

select * from tblemployees where Salary > avg(Salary)

Group By :  
- All columns in the select list apart from the aggregates have to be included in the group by 



where clause : works on each row to check if the condition is met
having clause : works on each group to check if the condition is met     

The DQL works in the following order
  - from clause
  - where clause
  - group by clause
  - having clause  
  - order by clause   
  - select   

Sub query : query within query  
- the subquery/inner query will execute once and before the outer/main query, and the result of the subquery is used by the main query

Guidelines for subquery
 1. Enclose subqueries in parentheses
 2. Place the subquery on the right side of the comparison operator
 3. Use Single-row operators with single row subqueries
      and multi row operators with multirow subqueries

Single row operators : =, >, <, >=, <=, !=, <>

Multi row operators : in, any, all  ( they can be used in conjunction with the single row operator)
