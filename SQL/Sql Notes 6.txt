Transactions Management :
A database transaction consists of 
   -dml statements that constitutes changes
   -ddl
   -dcl
Begins when the first dml statement is executed
Ends with one of the following
   - A commit or a rollback statement
   - Auto commit
   - User exits
   - System crashes

With commit and rollback statements, we can ensure
    - Data Consistency
    - Preview data changes before making changes permanent
    - Group logically related operations

Save Transactions 
    - Are logical markers of a set of operations in atransaction
    - It is not ANSI standard SQL

Transactions can be grouped and saved under a logical name. This helps us to decide whether to go ahead or undo the changes
  If we want to undo certain sql statements, we can rollback till a logical transaction
  If we don't want any transactions, then simply type Rollback
  If we want changes to be made permanent, then issue just a commit 

A : Atomicity 

C : Consistency

I : Isolation

D : Durability

Locks in transaction help in having consistent and durable data
They are of 2 types 
   1. Shared Lock
   2. Exclusive Lock

set implicit_transactions on/off - enables or disables the auto commit mode


Triggers : is like a procedure/function that can be used to define business rules/constraints
  - are reused, but unlike procedures/functions, they are not called explicitly, but fired automatically
     on any event (DDL, DML)

- They can before/after or instead of triggers (before the event, after the event or instead of the event)

triggers -> fire on an object-->when an event occurs on the object 

Magic Tables : are temporary tables that gets created when a trigger is fired on an event.
               - The scope of the Magic Table is within the trigger body
               - They are 2 in nos.
                     Inserted
                     Deleted 

 update events are always delete followed by insert

create trigger <triggername>
on table/views
instead of insert,update,delete
as
begin

end


Views : are virtual tables

DDL triggers : They are of 2 types

 1. Database Scoped DDL triggers (database level)
 2. Server Scoped DDL Triggers (Server Level - all database)
