Transactions Management :
A database transaction consists of 
   -dml statements that constitutes changes
   -ddl
   -dcl
Begins when the first dml statement is executed
Ends with one of the following
   - A commit or a rollback statement
   - Auto commit
   - User exits
   - System crashes

With commit and rollback statements, we can ensure
    - Data Consistency
    - Preview data changes before making changes permanent
    - Group logically related operations

Save Transactions 
    - Are logical markers of a set of operations in atransaction
    - It is not ANSI standard SQL

Transactions can be grouped and saved under a logical name. This helps us to decide whether to go ahead or undo the changes
  If we want to undo certain sql statements, we can rollback till a logical transaction
  If we don't want any transactions, then simply type Rollback
  If we want changes to be made permanent, then issue just a commit 

A : Atomicity 

C : Consistency

I : Isolation

D : Durability

Locks in transaction help in having consistent and durable data
They are of 2 types 
   1. Shared Lock
   2. Exclusive Lock
