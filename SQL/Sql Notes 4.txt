Common Table Expression (CTE) : Allows us to define a named temporary result set that is available within the execution scope
- we can perform dml operations
- we can have multiple ctes separated with a ','
- one cte can refer to other cte's
- we can recursive ctes'

Advantages :Reusability (cte reference to other ctes, recursive ctes')
            Complex queries can be broken down into different ctes
            more readable
            does not occupy memory


Disadvantages : can be used only within the scope of its declaration in the main query.
                not supported by many database platforms


Stored Procedures : 
Any query will be parsed and then a plan for execution is created and then executed as per plan, by the SQL Engine. In order to avoid the above repetitive task, we can store the query along with the execution plan as an object inside the database schema. This is stored procedure

-- Procedures can may or may not take parameters
-- Procedures can take input parameters (more than 1)
-- Procedures can give output parameters  (more than 1)
-- All Procedures return an integer return type 
-- Procedures can implement DQL/DML statements inside them
-- Procedures can call other procedures
-- Procedures can call functions
