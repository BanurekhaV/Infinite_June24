Corelated Subquery : Is a way of reading every row in a table and comparing values in each row against related data
- it is used whenever a subquery must return different result set for each candidate row by the main query
- can use all and any operators
- can be used for deletion and updation
- inner queries are driven by the outer query value
- are dependent on the outer query for its values
- they are executed repeatedly till end of result set/record set 


-Bulk insertion using 'insert into select'

--identity columns : are columns that ensure automatic data insertion. There is no need to provide data for the column
- are always integers
- they can take a seed value and an increment value
- The default seed and increment are (1,1)

-difference between delete, truncate, drop

Drop : is a ddl command
       drops an object from the database schema permanently along with the data

Truncate : is a ddl command
           deletes data and retains the structure
           cannot restrict deletion
           cannot roll back
           faster than delete
  
delete : is a dml command
         deletes all data and retains the structure
         restricts delete with a where clause
         can be rolled back 

Hard delete : permanent deletion, cannot retrieve
Soft Delete : record is updated with status/remarks etc but is available 

Case : works as alternates for any condition
 Simple Case : case keyword is immediately followed by case expression and before when statement
 Searched Case : case keyword is followed by when statement. There is no expression between case and when statements
 Nested Case : case within case
                   case within if-else

T-Sql : programming with sql
 - variables
 if else
 case
 while
 break, continue

set commands : are operators that can work with multiple result sets(query output)

Rules for using set operators :
 1. the result set of both the queries must have the same number of columns
 2. the datatypes of the columns of both the result set must be same
 3. the positional ordering of the column returned by the query must be same
 4. In case we need sorted output, we can order only the final result

- Union : removes duplicates from the concatenation of 2 or more result sets
- union all : includes duplicates

intersect : is used to get records common to all result sets retrieved from multiple queries or tables

Except : is used to retrieve records which are found in one query , but not in another. Returns records which are unique to one resultset
