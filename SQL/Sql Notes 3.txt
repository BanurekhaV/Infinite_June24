Corelated Subquery : Is a way of reading every row in a table and comparing values in each row against related data
- it is used whenever a subquery must return different result set for each candidate row by the main query
- can use all and any operators
- can be used for deletion and updation
- inner queries are driven by the outer query value
- are dependent on the outer query for its values
- they are executed repeatedly till end of result set/record set 


-Bulk insertion using 'insert into select'

--identity columns : are columns that ensure automatic data insertion. There is no need to provide data for the column
- are always integers
- they can take a seed value and an increment value
- The default seed and increment are (1,1)

-difference between delete, truncate, drop

Drop : is a ddl command
       drops an object from the database schema permanently along with the data

Truncate : is a ddl command
           deletes data and retains the structure
           cannot restrict deletion
           cannot roll back
           faster than delete
  
delete : is a dml command
         deletes all data and retains the structure
         restricts delete with a where clause
         can be rolled back 

Hard delete : permanent deletion, cannot retrieve
Soft Delete : record is updated with status/remarks etc but is available 

Case : works as alternates for any condition
 Simple Case : case keyword is immediately followed by case expression and before when statement
 Searched Case : case keyword is followed by when statement. There is no expression between case and when statements
 Nested Case : case within case
                   case within if-else
