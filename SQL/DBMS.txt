DBMS : Database Management System

Database : Defined as the storage of inter related data that has been organized in such a fashion that the process of retrieval of data is efficient and effective

Management System : Set of programs to access the data

DBMS : is an environment that is both convenient and efficient

Purpose of DBMS : Earlier data was stored directly on top of the file system
Drawbacks of file system :
  - Data redundancy and inconsistency
  - Difficulty in accessing the data
  - Data isolation - multiple files and formats
  - Integrity problems
  - Atomicity of Updates
  - Concurrent access to multiple users
  - Security Problems

DBMS architecture : 3 layered
1. Physical : actual data stored in the Hard disk
2. Logical/Conceptual : Customer (custid , Name , Address, country, phone,
3. Application :application programs can hide sensitive data from the user and provide only the rest

Data Modelling : A collection of tools for describing
  - Data
  - Data Relationships
  - Data Semantics
  - Data Constraints

Types of DBMS :
  1. HDBMs - Hierarchical Database management system 
  2. NDBMS - Network Dbms
  3. RDBMS - Relation dbms (Relational Algebra/set theory) 
  4. Object RDBMS 
      - multimedia
      - hypertext based databases


RDBMs : Data is perceived to be in rows and columnar structures knows as Relations/Tables
        Columns are the attributes that describe the data 
        Rows contain the actual data

E.F Codd - he coined the 12 golden rules on which any RDBMS has to be built

E-R Modelling (Entity Relation Ship model)  Dr.Chen
 - Entity : is anything that exists and is distinguishable 
 - Entity Set : a group of similar entities
 - Attribute - Properties that describe an entity
 - Relationship - an association between entities
         - one to one
         - one to many
         - many to many

Important terms:
 - Relation - a table
 - Tuple - a row in a table
 - Attribute - a column in a table
 - Degree - number of columns
 - Cardinality - number of tuples

Keys : Super key
Candidate Key :
Alternate Key : 

Primary Key : a column that can identify a tuple/row unique. Cannot be duplicates or nulls

Composite/Compound Primary Key : a combination of one or more columns put together to identify a unique row

Foreign Key : a column in one relation that always looks up to the primary key column in another relation. Can be duplicated and can have null values

Unique Key : is similar to the primary key, but can support one null value.

Integrity Constraints :
Constraints are the rules enforced on the data columns of a table. They are used to limit the type of the data, range of the data
    1. Domain Integrity : states that every element from a relation should respect the type and the restrictions on the length, range, null, default data etc
            (check, default, unique, null/not null)
    2. Entity Integrity : states that no pk should be null or duplicate  (primary key)
    3. Referential Integrity : is specified between 2 relations and is used to maintain consistency among the tuples in 2 relations (foreign key)

MS SQL Server :

  Structured Query Language : Basic Components 
  1. DDL - Data Definition Lang (create, drop, alter, truncate)
  2. DML - Data Manipulation lang (insert, delete, update)
  3. DQL - Data Query lang (select)
  4. TCL - Transaction Control lang (Commit, Rollback)
  5. DCL - Data Control lang (Grant, Revoke)

Datatypes :
   char(n)
   varchar(n)
   int / integer
   number (p,d)
   float
   real
   double
   money
   ntext
   date

Create <object> <object name>
   create database <database name> - under master database
  - move to the created database either using the down arrow of the drop down or type use <databasename>

create table <tablename>
(
  col1 <datatype><datasize> <constraints>,
 col2 <datatype><datasize> <constraints>,
col n
)
 
-insert into <tablename> values(positional columns as per the table)
-insert into(col list) values(as col list) - to insert into few columns, provided the rest can either take a null value or has a default value

--to add a new column to the created table
  alter table <tablename>
  add <column name> datatype size  <constraint are allowed if the table is without any data)

-- to add a constraint to a column after table creation
  alter table <tablename>
  add constraint <constraint name> < constraint type> <tablename>(<column name>)
