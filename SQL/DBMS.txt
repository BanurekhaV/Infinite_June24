DBMS : Database Management System

Database : Defined as the storage of inter related data that has been organized in such a fashion that the process of retrieval of data is efficient and effective

Management System : Set of programs to access the data

DBMS : is an environment that is both convenient and efficient

Purpose of DBMS : Earlier data was stored directly on top of the file system
Drawbacks of file system :
  - Data redundancy and inconsistency
  - Difficulty in accessing the data
  - Data isolation - multiple files and formats
  - Integrity problems
  - Atomicity of Updates
  - Concurrent access to multiple users
  - Security Problems

DBMS architecture : 3 layered
1. Physical : actual data stored in the Hard disk
2. Logical/Conceptual : Customer (custid , Name , Address, country, phone,
3. Application :application programs can hide sensitive data from the user and provide only the rest

Data Modelling : A collection of tools for describing
  - Data
  - Data Relationships
  - Data Semantics
  - Data Constraints

Types of DBMS :
  1. HDBMs - Hierarchical Database management system 
  2. NDBMS - Network Dbms
  3. RDBMS - Relation dbms (Relational Algebra/set theory) 
  4. Object RDBMS 
      - multimedia
      - hypertext based databases


RDBMs : Data is perceived to be in rows and columnar structures knows as Relations/Tables
        Columns are the attributes that describe the data 
        Rows contain the actual data

E.F Codd - he coined the 12 golden rules on which any RDBMS has to be built

E-R Modelling (Entity Relation Ship model)  Dr.Chen
 - Entity : is anything that exists and is distinguishable 
 - Entity Set : a group of similar entites
 - Attribute - Properties that describe an entity
 - Relationship - an association between entities
