Layouts : We can have custom layouts, whcih can be applied to different views
We can skip layouts also for some views by setting the layout to null.
These layouts should be placed inside the shared folder



Partial Views : are also like regular views, which can be reused multiple times in  other views, rather than creating that many times

  1. Html.RenderPartial
