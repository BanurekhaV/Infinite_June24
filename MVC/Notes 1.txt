ASP.Net MVC : is a very popular framework for developing web based applications
-Asp.net MVC is based on the Model View Controller pattern, making the development robust,fast and secure applications
-It is the next generation technology succeeding Asp.net Web forms

Features:
- Separation of concerns
- Light weight
- Designs and codes are neatly separated
- Uses pure HTML controls(Html Helpers), and no server controls
- Uses controller based routing
- Implements no view state
- Uses Razor Syntax for customization
- Uses Layouts instead of Master pages
- It is an Open Source Technology

Models : Is responsible for keeping data based operations and logics like connecting to the data source, retrieving data, storing.

Views : Is responsible for serving the web page or user interface to the client

Controllers : Are responsible for business/programming logics and anchors both the Models and the Views


App_Data : this folder contains data files like local db,.xml,.mdf etc.

App_Start : Contains classes with static methods that are called during Application start

Controllers : Contains classes that handles the request and response. All controllers names have to be suffixed with 'controller' keyword

Views : Contains Html with the Razor syntax and is always referred with .cshtml (in case of C#). This folder will have separate folders for each controller with the same name. Inside these folders we can have the corresponding views for the action method

 - it also contains a folder called Shared , which has the Layout and error files to give the master layout for the application, and to handle application errors

 -_ViewStart.cshtml : is used to place all common UI Logics across all the views



Controllers : Main part of MVC
- Mediators between client and the server 
- Bridge between Models and Views
- The url is always mapped with a controller

Action methods : are methods inside controllers
- They are always public
- They cannot be overloaded
- They cannot be static 
- Every controller has atleast one default action method called Index()
- Every action method returns a type of ActionResult (base class for all types of return)

Return types of action methods : all the below types are inherited from ActionResult class directly or transitively
 - ViewResult :
 - EmptyResult :
 - RedirectResult :
 - JsonResult :
 - JavascriptResult :
 - ContentResult :
 - FileContentResult :
 - FilePathResult :
 - FileStreamResult : 

Views :(.cshtml) allows writing eazor synatx, a powerful and easier way of writing program code directly on the html based view page 
- Razor syntax is like a markup that allows embedding program code with html
- Uses '@{}' block to write program code
- All the inline expressions like variables and functions starts with @
- variables are declared using var keyword, and all the code statements end with a ';'
- string values are give within " "
- Comments in razor is as
 @*  ...    *@ --- multiple lines
 /* ... */
 //  single line comments

To access the model data in the view we use @model

@model binds a model object to the view
@Model can access the properties of the bound model object
