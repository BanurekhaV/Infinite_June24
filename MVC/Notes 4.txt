Custom Model Validations : are classes that inherit from ValidationAttribute class and can perform validations needed as per the business logic




Html Helpers : are C# methods that return HTML strings, which are used in the Views for generating the html content
-We can have custom helpers

Types of HTML Helpers :

1. Inline Html helper : are used on a single view of the same page. They area created using @helper tag

Eg : @helper MyInlinehelper(string[] words)
{
<ol>
 @foreach(string w in words)
{
  <li>@w</li>
}
}

2. Built in Html Helper :

 1. Standard Html Helper : are mainly used for rendering typical html elements
Eg : @Html.Action()  - to create links on the html page
     @Html.TextBox()  - to create a textbox
     @Html.BeginForm()  - to start form action

 2. Strongly typed Html Helper : These take lambda expressions with parameters and tells the helper which element of the model to be used in the view

Eg : @html.LabelFor()
     @html.TextBoxFor()

 3. Templated Html Helper : is used for data display and input. It generates html automatically as the per the model property and for the complete model with just a single tag. It is divided into 2 categories
   a) Display Template
  
 eg : @html.Display(), @html.DisplayFor(), @html.DisplayForModel()  // single tag for the entire model

     b) Editor Template
 eg : @html.Editor(), @html.EditorFor()
      @html.EditorForModel() ; //single tag for the entire model
