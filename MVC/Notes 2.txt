ViewBag, ViewData, TempData

ViewBag  : Is a Dynamic Datatype
- is used to pass the data from the controller to the view
- has a short life, meaning once the data is passed to the action methods view from the controller, it becomes null
- Data is not available for further request
- does not need any typecasting

Eg :
ViewBag.myData = "This is my Data";

and to access this data in the view page,
 @ViewBag.myData


ViewData : Is a Dictionary Object and is derived from ViewDataDictionary 
- is also used for sending information from controller to the view
- once data is sent to the view, it becomes null
- Uses key-value pair to store and retrieve data
- Requires typecasting wherever needed.(complex object)
- Data is not available for further request

Eg :

ViewData["myData"] = "This is my Data";

and to access

@ViewData["myData"]


TempData : Is used to transfer data from controller to the view
-It internally uses session to store values
-It is a dictionary Object deriving from TempDataDictionary
-It allows data transfers in subsequent request, using TempData.Keep() method.
-Needs Typecasting
-Has a bigger Life than ViewBag and ViewData
-Mostly used to transfer data from one controller to another.
