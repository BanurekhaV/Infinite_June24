Securing a web application :

Authenticate : Who the user is ? The process of identifying the users

Authorization : What rights the user has ? What resources the user can access. The process of granting access to the user on a resource based on the identity

Types of Authentications :

1. Anonymous Authentication : allows users to access public areas of the website without any credentials

2. Windows Authentication : Identifies and authorizes users, based on the server's user list. Access to resources on the server are granted/denied accordingly (privileges of the user account)
-it is best suited for intranet applications

3. Form Based authentication : is used for internet applications, where the users need not be the members of their domain based network
    Eg : gmail, facebook,irctc, amazon etc..

4. Role Based Authentication : User roles are mapped to forms/windows in order to gain access to resources

5. Passport Authentication : Paid Service that uses 'claims' authentication method, generated from other applications to authenticate self
  flow of events in passport authentication :
   - User Log in, then passport.authenticate() is called which implements some strategy/logic to verify
   - If success, then it serializes the User details as an object and creates a unique identifier for the user
   - the unique user details are stored in the session of that user, which is used for all further transactions (request/response)
