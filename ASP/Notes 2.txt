Caching : is concept of storing the web page/s in the client machine in order to provide response quickly instead of fetching it from the server.


Response.Redirect  vs Server.Transfer

Both are meant for navigation from one page to another

Response.Redirect : the object transfers the page permanently to the given page and ends the processing of the first page, and the new page processing continues. 
It also sends a command back to the browser (that it has stopped the processing of the current page and started processing the new page
leading to an extra unnecessary round trip)

  Usage of response.redirect :
    1. Want our users to be able to see the newly redirected url.
    2. We want to redirect to a new page as well as a new webserver
    3. We do not want to preserve(state) of the form variables of the original request
    4. we don't mind extra roundtrip

Server.Transfer : this helps in navigating between pages of the same application or within the same web server
The original page is still in the memory that can read the values directly from the new page
The page is not redirected permanently unlike the response. redirect.

 Usage of server.transfer :
   1. to transfer the current page to another page of the same server
   2. To preserve server resources and avoid unnecessary roundtrips to the server
   3. to preserve the form variables
   4. need not disclose the url address of all the navigating pages
