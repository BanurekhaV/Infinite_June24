Validation Controls : These are some of the in-built controls in asp.net web form applications viz
1. RequiredField  -  must field
2. Range      - Data range of values
3. Compare   - compare one input with another
4. Regular Expression  - pattern matchings
5. Custom - to handle any other validations that are beyond the above

In the web.config file, make an entry as below to enable javascript libraries to execute validation functionalities

<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="ValidationSettings:UnobtrusiveValidationMode" value="none"/>
  </appSettings>


Note : Button control and drop down controls always result in a postback (it is not default action for drop down ultil we specify the postback event)
