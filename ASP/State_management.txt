State management : The ability to retain the state of the page in terms of its values in various controls

Applications manages the state using techniques as below:

1. Client Side techniques
  a) ViewState
  b) Hidden fields
  c) Cookies
  d) Query Strings


a) View State : View State : is a variable of object type that need not be typecasted
 - Can store any data including UDT(user defined type)
 - It gets stored in the client application
 - Can retain the state across multiple post backs of the same page


b) Hidden Fields : is a control in the toolbox, which is not visible at runtime
-It is a class that needs to be initialized, and also initialize all its members. This can be a load on the system
-Can be used if in case we need to store few values only, and use Viewstate for many values
-Like Viewstate, hidden fields also can maintain state only across the same page post backs


c) Cookies : allow managing the state across pages
     Cookies are of 2 types
           1. Persistent Cookies( uses an object of HttpCookies class to persist the state)
           2. Non persistent cookie (data is stored directly in the response object )

d) Query String : allow managing the state across pages
