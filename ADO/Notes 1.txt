ADO.Net : Activex Data Objects, a database technology 
 - is a part of the .net framework that provides classes and functions to bridge the front end and the backend databases
 - the ADO.net object encapsulates all the data access operations and allows the Frontend to perform CRUD by hiding the details of the movement of data
 - scalable and interoperable

Connection Architecture :

are of 2 types
   1. Connected Architecture : the application remains connected with the database throughout the processing

   2. Disconnected Architecture : the application automatically connects/disconnects during the process. The application uses a temporary data on the application side called as DataSet

Connection class : helps in establishing the connection with the database server, database using credentials

Command class : helps in execution sql statements/procedures . This has functions viz.
     ExecuteReader() - returns data to the client as rows of information using a DataReader Object. Typically a sql select or a procedure with select statements are executed with this function
     ExecuteNonQuery() - returns an int(no. of rows affected). is used during dml operations or in procedures with dml statements

 -- Use the System.Data namespace also for certain other classes
-- Use the System.Data.SqlClient namespace 


--if windows authentication
con = new SqlConnection("data source = LAPTOP-TJJ7D977; initial catalog = InfiniteDB;" +
                "integrated security = true;");

--if sql authentication
con = con = new SqlConnection("data source = LAPTOP-TJJ7D977; initial catalog = InfiniteDB;" +
                "user id= sa; password=123;");

--or as below
con = new SqlConnection("server = LAPTOP-TJJ7D977; database = InfiniteDB;" +
                "integrated security = true;");
