LINQ : Language Integrated Query
 - is a query lang that is a standard to query any data source
 - less code
 - more readable
 - provides intellisense support
 - compile time safety
 - familiar lang

There 2 basic ways to write linq queries
  1. Query Syntax/Query Expression
          from <range variable> in <IEnumerable>/<IQueryable> standard operators <lambda exp>
                               select or group by
  2. Method Syntax /Method Extensions /fluent ( makes use of extension operators and lambda)


LINQ - Collections (arrays)
LINQ - Objects (classes)
LINQ - Datatable (collection - 2dimension)
LINQ - SQL

Linq has 2 ways of execution
   1. Deferred   : default execution. Also known as lazy operator
     - Query is not executed at the point of its declaration/construction. It is executed when we access the query result. 
     - Projection Operators used : select, selectMany
     - Restriction Operators used  : where 
     - Paging Operators used : take,skip
 

   2. Immediate : Is also Known as Greedy Operators
    - Query is executed at the point of declaration/construction
    - Aggregate Functions, Element Operators (first, last, single, tolist, toarray, todictionary)

Benefits of deferred execution : Avoids unnecessary query execution and hence improves performance
    - Query Construction and execution are decoupled
    - A deferred query is re-evaluated  when we enumerate , hence always gets the latest data
