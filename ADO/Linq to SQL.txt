Linq to SQL : Offers runtime infrastructure for the management of relational data as objects

Tables --> Classes
Columns --> Properties
Rows ---> Instances
StoredProcedures ---> Functions/Methods

In order to work with Linq-Sql, we need to convert all relational objects to programming objects. This process of mapping is known as ORM (Object Relational mapper/mapping)

Advantages : We can query database object as a .net object
development becomes faster
intellisense support
type safety is ensured by the compiler
Can Handle SQL Injection attack

mapped objects are generated using either
1. Visual Studio (using Linq-sql classes, generating a .dbml file, that has the mappings)
2. SQL Metal (a tool which is an .exe, that generates the .dbml file)

Steps for working with VS:
