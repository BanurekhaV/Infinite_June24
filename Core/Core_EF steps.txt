packages to be included 

1. Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer : on installing this package
  Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore as well as Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational gets added

2. Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools (design)


in the PM console type the below to get the models mapped

Scaffold-DbContext "Server=LAPTOP-TJJ7D977;Database=Northwind;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Models

Note : Whenever there is any change made to the tables, we can retype the above command with -F option in the end

Scaffold-DbContext "Server=LAPTOP-TJJ7D977;Database=Northwind;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Models -F

Also make an entry in appsettings.json as below

 },
 "AllowedHosts": "*",
 "ConnectionStrings": {
   "Northwinddbconn": "Server=Laptop-tjj7d977;Database=Northwind;Integrated Security=True;TrustServerCertificate=True"

 }
 }


ASP.net core dependency injection system has 3 options for registering the services

AddTransient : A new instance of the services is created every time a request is received, and post the request the instance is disposed. 

AddScopped : An instance of the service is created and is reused throughout the scope of the session, and then gets disposed

In the Program.cs file register all the dependencies and also use the UseSqlServer middleware 

AddSingleton : A single instance serves for the entire application and is shared among all requests and clients


Check program.cs File for service registration



Code First Approach :

-Create an MVC application
-Add Model class/es to the models folder
-Add a Connection string in appsettings.json file
-Create a Context Class and make an entry of the model classes
-Register the DbContext class along with Sqlservices in the program.cs file
-Build once
-in the PM Console, migrate using
   Add-Migration "<name>"
   Update-database
Then you can create respective controllers and perform actions
