ASP.net core dependency injection system has 3 options for registering the services

AddTransient : A new instance of the services is created every time a request is received, and post the request the instance is disposed. 

AddScopped : An instance of the service is created and is reused throughout the scope of the session, and then gets disposed

In the Program.cs file register all the dependencies and also use the UseSqlServer middleware 

AddSingleton : A single instance serves for the entire application and is shared among all requests and clients
