Web Technologies : 

WWW : World Wide Web
  Network of Information
    - A uniform naming scheme for locating resources on the web (URI)
    - Protocol, for access to the named resources over the web (HTTP)
    - Hyper Text, for easy navigation among resources   (HTML)

Every resource(html document, images, videos, programs, application) on the web has an address that can be accessed using URI

Eg : http://www.mypage.com/mydir
1. the protocol to access the resource
2. the name of the machine hosting the resources
3. The resource itself

URI > (URN || URL)
