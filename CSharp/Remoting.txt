Remoting : Is a mechanism for communication between objects of various applications, that may not be in the same process(domain), nor in the same system,
- Which may be using different transport protocols, serialization formats etc

- Is a Microsoft framework that provides services like
    * object activation
    * life time support of objects
    * communication channels
    * Transport messages(xml,json,binary,text)

Domain : When an application is loaded onto the memory, a process is created within that application. This is known as Application Domain

Contexts : A context is a set of common constraints, usage, access, functionalities within the object

Proxy/Proxies : 
Is an instance of the remote object directly available to the client. It does all marshalling across various context, and then forwards the request to the actual remote object

Marshalling : Specifies how a remote object is exposed to the client. The process of passing parameters from one context to another context is marshalling. There are 2 ways to marshal

      1. Marshal By Value : the server creates a copy of the object and passes the copy to the client
      2. Marshal By Ref : the client creates proxy for the remote object and uses this proxy for further processing

Channels : allows data /message transfers through a stream of bytes
   - HTTP Channel, TCP Channel

Types of Remote Objects :
     1. Single Call : Objects that serve one request
     2. Singleton :  Objects that serve multiple clients. One Object that serves all the request of the client. 
                     The server/remote,  maintains the state of each client
     3. Client Activated Objects : Upon client request for the remote object, the instance of the required object is activated, and the reference of the object is sent back to the client. A proxy object gets created at the client side. All calls will be executed on the proxy.

various techniques for Distributed Application:

-Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
-DCOM ( Distributed Component Object Model)
-Remoting - replacement of DCOM
-Web Services
-WCF (Windows Communication Framework)
-API (Application Programming Interface)


Steps for Remoting :

1. Create a class Library, where all remote objects are created
2. Create a Console Application - Host/server that hosts the class library
3. Create Client Application
