Generics : a way of creating classes, methods, indexers, properties, constructors, fields etc decoupled with the data type
           lets us define type-safe classes, without compromising
               - type-safety
               - performance
               - productivity

ArrayList				List
HashTable				Dictionary
SortedList				SortedList<>
Stacks					Stack<>
Queue					Queue<>

IEnumerable/IEnumerator  : to be able to iterate a collection. 
Both the interface does the same job, but IEnumerable has a shorter code, where as IEnumerator has a little longer code.
