* Literal Movements : enhanced reading options of data
* Dictionary Initializers 
* Local Functions : If we want to execute some piece of code many times within a method, then we can make use of local functions
- Local functions can be called anytime within the Parent/enclosing function only
- They cannot be overloaded
- The cannot have access modifiers
- Compiler will raise a warning if the local functions are not called by the parent function
- All variables of the enclosing scope(parent function) can be accessed by the local function

* Throws Expression : ease of use
*Expression bodied members : is a feature that simplifies syntactic expression in programming. Similar like lambda expressions
*Nullable type : Nullable<T> : generic structure that allows primitive/value types to have nulls
  null conditional Operator : (?.) is a simpler way of checking null objects. It is a cleaner and concise code where it removes extra null usage
