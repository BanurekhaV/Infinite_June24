Delegates : are like function pointers of C,C++.
            A delegate is a reference type object that holds the reference to a method/function
            the delegate reference can be changed at runtime (dynamic)

Steps for Delegate usage :
  1. declare a delegate with signature
  2. Create objects of the delegate
  3. Assign any function that matches the signature of the delegate
  4. Call the delegate with arguments if any

Multicast Delegates: an object of the delegate is made to point to many methods that match the signature
                    - If we do multicasting to many methods with return values, then the delegate object would return only the value of the last method

we can also pass the Delegate object as an argument/parameter to a function 

We can have Generic delegates thru which we achieve polymorphism

Anonymous Delegates : are delegates that point to functions without name
