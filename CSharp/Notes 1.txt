Dot Net Framework : Microsoft .net pronounced as Dot net is a software component 
 - provides tools and libraries that enable the developers to create application software much easier and faster
 - provides language independence and platform independence

Major Components of the .Net Architecture
1. Common language Specification  (CLS):
          Common Type Specification  : (int, integer, number)

2. Framework Class Library (FCL):has more than 7000 classes and data types to enable .net applications to
     - read/write
     - access database  
     - process xml files
     - display graphics
     - use web services etc...

3. Common Language Runtime (CLR) : refer jpg file

4. .Net Tools  : IDE (Integrated Development Environment) 

In conclusion ..
   Dotnet is Microsoft's web Service strategy to connect information, people, systems and devices through the framework software
 - It provides a standard set of services
   1. Data Access and connectivity ( ADO.Net)
   2. User Interface (Winforms,WPF)
   3. WebApplications (Asp.net, Silverlight)
   4. NetworkCommunication (WCF) and Work Flow(WWF)



On compilation of a C# program, we get an assembly file created (MSIL/IL/CIL) which is a managed code

-Assemblies are of 2 type viz. 1. .exe, and 2. .dll (depends on the type of application we create)

Every dotnet application contains 2 steps
  1. Compilation - Source code to IL
  2. Execution On JIT Compilation  - IL to platform specific native code

The native code is not stored anywhere. Once the program execution is over, it is discarded. Created when we need to execute again
