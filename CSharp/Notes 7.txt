Interfaces : are like classes which contain properties, methods, delegates, events, but only declarations and no implementation
- are declared using 'interface' keyword
- interface members are public by default
- they do not allow explicit access modifiers
- the class that inherits from the interface will have to provide implementation to all the members
- a class can inherit from multiple interface (class a : iint1, iint2, iint3)
- interfaces can inherit from other interfaces (interface IMyinterface : IYourInterface, IourInterface)
- we cannot create interface instance , but a reference object can be made to point to the derived classes 

Advantages :
 - it is used to achieve loose coupling
 - it is used to achieve total abstraction
 - it is used to achieve component-based programming
 - multiple inheritance and abstraction
 - they add a plug and play like architecture into applications

Inheritance Chain : Implementing all the methods of all the interfaces in the hierarchy is known as interface chaining

Explicit Interface Implementation : When a class implements 2 or more interfaces, and if those interfaces have the same method(including the signature), we can go for explicit implementation

Points for explicit interface implementation
1. the explicit method has to be preceded with the name of the interface (as per the demo IProducts.productDetails())
2. We have to remove the modifier as it is not allowed ( remove the public keyword)
3. Write the implementation code

In order to execute the explicitly implemented methods, we have 2 options
 1. Create Interface reference variable and make it point to the Implementing class 
 
 2. Create implementing class object and typecast it to the interface
